## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total components tested | 2 |
| Components with issues | 2 |
| Failure ratio | 100% |
| Failure tier | **GLOBAL** |

> [!CAUTION]
> **GLOBAL ENGINE FAILURE** — Over 75% of components are failing. This is almost certainly a regression in the core simulation engine, not individual components. Suspect files: `grading-engine.worker.ts`, `simulation.worker.ts`, `execute.ts`.
