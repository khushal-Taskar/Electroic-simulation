## Overview

OpenHW Studio Frontend is the **visual client** of the simulator platform. It allows users to:

- Design circuits by placing and wiring components on a canvas
- Write and edit Arduino C++ code in a built-in syntax-highlighted editor
- Compile and run simulations powered by the backend compiler and the in-browser Web Worker emulator
- Watch simulation output in real time (LEDs blinking, NeoPixels lighting up, servo movement, etc.)
- Save and load projects locally — **guests included** — using IndexedDB

It connects to one backend service:
- **Compiler Backend** (`http://localhost:5001`) — compiles C++ code to `.hex`

The simulation itself runs entirely **in the browser** via a Web Worker powered by `avr8js`.

## Pages

### `SimulatorPage.jsx`
The core of the application. Responsibilities include:
- **Circuit Canvas** — drag, drop, and wire Wokwi components
- **Resizable Explorer** — The file explorer panel is resizable for better code editing space
- **Tabbed Interface** — Right panel features high-visibility interactive tabs for Editor, Explorer, and Console
- **Code Editor** — write Arduino sketches with syntax highlighting; `diagram.json` is protected as read-only
- **Undo/Redo** — Quick toolbar actions for circuit design with updated iconography
- **Run/Stop** — triggers compilation → `.hex` delivery → Web Worker `START` message
- **Live State Rendering** — receives `{ type: "state", pins: {...} }` at 60 FPS and updates component visual attributes (LEDs, NeoPixels, etc.)
- **Component Registry** — maps component type names to their imported index definitions from `@openhw/emulator`
- **Project Save/Load** — auto-saves to IndexedDB every 2.5 s; "My Projects" modal for named saves; auto-loads last project on mount
- **Offline resilience** — hex cache survives page refresh; ZIP uploads queue while offline

### `LoginPage.jsx`
Google OAuth 2.0 login page. Decodes JWT and stores user info in `AuthContext`.

### `AdminPage.jsx`
A powerful administrative hub for platform maintenance:
- **3-Column Management**: Independent scrollable panels for Libraries, Pending Submissions, and Installed Components.
- **Review Workflow**: Admins can check submissions with live Transpile feedback, download source ZIPs, or open them in a live Simulator "Test" tab.
- **Real-time Actions**: Approval instantly moves components to the backend; rejection removes specific submissions (unique per upload).
- **Library Manager**: Search and uninstall system-level C++ libraries for the Arduino compiler.

### `LandingPage.jsx`
Public-facing landing page describing the platform.

### `StudentDashboard.jsx` / `TeacherDashboard.jsx`
Role-specific dashboards shown after login.

## Key Features

### ElectroSim AI Tutor
ElectroSim AI adds a collapsible, context-aware electronics tutor to the desktop simulator without replacing the circuit workspace. The tutor consumes live simulator state from `src/ai/circuitContext.js`, including board, components, pins, wires, code, runtime state, selected component/wire, and validation findings.

Tutor features include:
- selected-component explanations
- explain-my-circuit summaries
- connection assistant guidance tied to real component IDs and pins
- AI debug reports with evidence, likely cause, suggested fix, confidence, and optional hints
- three-level progressive hints
- practice challenge mode with topology/code validation
- non-punitive Electronics Skill Score
- derived visual signal-flow summaries

The frontend performs deterministic local circuit analysis first, then optionally asks the backend AI provider for an enhanced explanation. If backend AI is unavailable, simulator editing, validation, and local tutor analysis continue to work.

Private AI provider keys are never stored in frontend source or Vite environment variables. Configure AI on the backend only.

### Real-time Simulation Rendering (60 FPS)
The Web Worker runs the AVR CPU and posts state messages back to the main thread every frame. The frontend maps pin voltages to DOM attribute changes on Wokwi custom HTML elements.

```json
{ "type": "state", "pins": { "D13": true, "D6": false }, "neopixels": [...] }
```

### NeoPixel Matrix Support
- Wires NeoPixel components with `GND`, `VCC`, `DIN`, `DOUT` pins
- Sends matrix topology (component ID, Arduino pin, size) in the Web Worker `START` message
- Calls `element.setPixel(row, col, {r, g, b})` directly on the Wokwi DOM element

### Analog Plotter / Logic Graph
A native high-performance `<canvas>` rendering engine tab traces simulated logic and analog signals. Users can dynamically specify which pins to track.

### Serial Monitor Integration
A built-in terminal streams `AVRUSART` traffic bidirectionally into the `.hex` loop.

### Physical Workspace Controls
The **Arduino Uno Reset Button** is fully interactive inside the workspace SVG visualizer, triggering a targeted `runner.cpu.reset()` reboot in the Web Worker.

### Web Worker Simulation
AVR simulation runs entirely in-browser via `src/worker/execute.ts` inside a Web Worker, keeping the UI thread completely unblocked.

### Pico / RP2040 Workflow
- Each Pico board folder now includes both `<boardId>.ino` and `main.py` starter files.
- File menu supports **Disable file / Enable file** by renaming with `.disabled` suffix.
- Disabled files are excluded from compile and MicroPython source selection.
- If backend RP2040 Arduino core is missing, `.ino` compile failures automatically fall back to MicroPython UF2 + `main.py`.

### Explorer Stability
- Project files are normalized and deduplicated when loading saved projects to prevent duplicate file entries after refresh.

### Zero-Touch Component Sync
The simulator polls the backend every 12 seconds for newly approved community components:
- **Dynamic Injection**: New components are transpiled and injected into the registry and palette without a page refresh.
- **Live Deletion**: If a component is uninstalled from the admin panel, it is purged from all active simulator sessions automatically.
- **Admin "Test" Mode**: An isolated preview mechanism uses `sessionStorage` to test pending components before approval.

### Auth Flow
- Google OAuth → JWT stored in context
- Role selection (Student / Teacher / Admin) → role-specific entry points
- Protected routes via `AuthContext` and `ProtectedRoute` components

## Offline & Storage Features

All storage features use the browser-native **IndexedDB API** and **Service Worker API**. No extra npm packages are required, and no backend changes are needed.

### Project Persistence (IndexedDB — `openhw-projects`)

Every circuit is automatically saved to a local IndexedDB database every **2.5 seconds** after any change. This works for both authenticated users and **guest users** with no login required.

| User type | Owner key | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Guest (no login) | `'guest'` | Projects saved locally, visible under "My Projects" on every visit |
| Authenticated user | `user.email` | Projects saved locally, scoped to that email |

**Buttons added to the header:**
- **Save** — opens a name dialog; pressing Enter or clicking Save commits the name
- **My Projects** — opens a modal listing all saved projects (name, board, components count, last-saved time) with Load and Delete actions
- **New** — starts a blank canvas (current project is preserved in IDB)
- **Project name chip** — shows the current project name in the header; click to rename

**On page load**, the most-recently saved project for the current user (or guest) is automatically restored.

### Compiled Hex Cache (IndexedDB — `openhw-offline`)

Compiled `.hex` results are saved to IndexedDB after every successful compile. On subsequent runs:

1. Check in-memory `lastCompiledRef` (fastest — same session)
2. Check IndexedDB cache (survives page refresh and offline)
3. Compile via `POST /api/compile` (requires network)

This means: **run your simulation offline after compiling at least once while online**.

### Offline ZIP Component Upload Queue (IndexedDB — `openhw-offline`)

If you upload a custom component ZIP while offline:
- The component is injected into the local registry immediately (usable right away)
- The backend submission is queued in IndexedDB
- When the internet is restored, the queue is automatically drained

### Service Worker (`public/sw.js`)

Cached on first load. Strategies:

| Request | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Navigation (`/`, any route) | Network-first → fallback to cached `index.html` |
| JS / CSS / images | Stale-while-revalidate (instant load + background update) |
| CDN scripts (wokwi-elements) | Stale-while-revalidate |
| `/api/*` | Network-only (never cached — hex caching is at the app layer) |

See **[OFFLINE_AND_STORAGE.md](../OFFLINE_AND_STORAGE.md)** for full technical details.

## Setup & Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- The **Compiler Backend** running at `http://localhost:5001`
- For Pico `.ino` compilation, backend must have `rp2040:rp2040` core installed.

### Installation

```bash
cd OpenHW-studio-frontend
npm install
```

### Local Development & NPM Linking
During local development, you will want the frontend to immediately see changes you make to the emulator source code, without having to push those changes to GitHub first.

We achieve this using **Vite Resolve Aliases**, which tell the frontend to use your local emulator repository folder. This is controlled by the `VITE_EMULATOR_PATH` variable in your `.env` file and bypasses the need for `npm link`.

Set the path to your own emulator repo name. It can be relative or absolute, as long as it points at the emulator repository root.

To set up your local development:
1. Ensure your `.env` file has the correct path:
   ```env
       VITE_EMULATOR_PATH=../path-to-openhw-studio-emulator
   ```
2. Restart the Vite dev server. The `@openhw/emulator` package will now point directly to your local source.

*Note: You can still use `npm link` if preferred, but the environment variable approach is more portable across different machines.*

### Production Deployment (Vercel / Docker)
For production builds (like on **Vercel**), the `VITE_EMULATOR_PATH` variable should be **left unset**. The `vite.config.js` is designed to automatically fallback to the `@openhw/emulator` package installed in `node_modules` (fetched from GitHub) if the local path is not found.

*Note: Once deployed to Vercel/Netlify, these local symlinks will be ignored and the remote server will correctly fetch the package directly from GitHub.*

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:5173**

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Environment Variables

The frontend uses Vite environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project directory:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID | — |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Base URL for the Backend API | `http://localhost:5001/api` |
| `VITE_EXAMPLES_BASE_URL` | Base URL for example assets served by the backend `EXAMPLES_PATH` route | `/api/examples` (or `http://localhost:5000/api/examples`) |
| `VITE_EMULATOR_PATH` | Local path to the emulator repository root used by Vite aliasing | `../path-to-openhw-studio-emulator` |
| `VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS` | Comma-separated list of admin emails | — |

### Sample `.env` Setup:

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
VITE_EXAMPLES_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api/examples
VITE_DEV_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:5001
VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@example.com,user@example.com
VITE_EMULATOR_PATH=../path-to-openhw-studio-emulator
```
